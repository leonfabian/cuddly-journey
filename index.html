    <h2>stereoscopic image</h2>
    <p>A stereoscopic image, also known as a 3D image, is an image that creates the illusion of depth by presenting two slightly different views of the same scene to each eye. When viewed with a stereoscope or 3D glasses, the brain combines the two images to create the perception of a three-dimensional space.

        To create a stereoscopic image of quantum computing, you would need to capture two slightly different perspectives of a quantum computing setup or simulation, with one image representing the left eye and the other representing the right eye. One way to do this is to take two photographs of the same scene from slightly different angles, or to render two images from different perspectives using 3D modeling software.
        
        Once you have the two images, you can combine them into a single stereoscopic image using image editing software. There are many tutorials available online that can guide you through the process.
        
        It's important to note that not all images are suitable for stereoscopic viewing. Images with too much clutter or too little contrast may not create a convincing 3D effect. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the two images are aligned correctly and that the distance between the two perspectives is appropriate for the viewing medium (e.g. the distance between the eyes for human viewers or the distance between the lenses in a stereoscope).
